## About this workshop

Machine Learning based approaches have become ubiquitous in many areas of society, industry and academia. Understanding what Machine Learning (ML) is, providing and reproducing what it infers, has become an essential prerequisite for adoption. In this line of thought, course materials, introductory media and lecture series of a broad variety, depth, quality and public availability have come to existence. To this date and to the best our knowledge, there is no structured approach to collect and discuss best practices in teaching Machine Learning. This workshop strives to change this. 

With our workshop, we want to start an academic discussion on what works and what doesn't. We would like to help improve existing material as a community and to make conceiving new material more effective.

## Motivation

Many experts and practitioners who develop Machine Learning models or infrastructure around these models are confronted with the opportunity or duty to teach Machine Learning at some point in their career. Traditionally, many  rely on their gut feeling to design courses that are motivated by these circumstances. The methods of choice are often Power Point or similar technologies and a lot of copy & pasting from the web. 

This workshop targets those who would like to know how teachers from around the globe approach teaching Machine Learning: How deep do they dive into the matter? What mental models do they use to visualize concepts? What media is at play in teaching ML by others? And much more.

With this workshop, we hope that all participants obtain a better feeling where they stand with their teaching and where they can improve or collaborate with others.

## Topics Covered

The main goal of this workshop is to motivate and nourish best practices at any stage of the teaching process. For this, we would like to cover a structured approach to teaching motivated by [the carpentries][https://cdh.carpentries.org/] or a variation thereof. As we believe that core concepts contained in this are vital for any teaching practitioners. 

The central activity of the workshop will be a twofold: 

1. a call-for-papers whereby teaching professionals or beginners are asked to describe their method of choice when teaching a given ML topic. We like to attract at maximum 4 page long mini articles (excluding references and acknowledgments) that present or discuss a teaching activity related to machine learning. For more details, see below.

2. (potentially parallel) **presentations of 5-10 minute lightning talks** during the workshop at ECML PKDD 2020 which present accepted papers mentioned above. For more details, see below.

## Call For Papers

We invite interested parties to submit a mini-paper describing a specific peace of teaching related to Machine Learning. These mini papers are expected to present teaching examples from various aspects of ML. For example:

* a demo of how to teach back-propagation
* expectation management for non-computer science learners of ML
* a discussion of an instructive data set for teaching Convolutional Neural Networks
* an interactive web application to play with parameters of a classifier (SVM, CNN, MLP, ...)
* a teaching metaphor to illustrate time series prediction
* how does bagging work?
* how can training a Deep Neural Network be parallized?
* an (interactive) visualization of stochastic gradient decent
* ...

We will conduct an open peer review using [openreview.net](https://openreview.net) on all contributions and select contributions based on the reviewers feedback. Here are important dates:

- April 27, 2020: Submission opens
- June 26, 2020: Submission Deadline (no submissions past this date)
- August 1, 2020: Paper Confirmations

Each submitted paper will be reviewed publicly by at least two experienced machine learning instructors. If you'd like to help out reviewing papers, please let us know and open an issue [here](repo) or [contact us](mailto:p.steinbach@hzdr.de).



## Workshop

### Preface 

To prepare for the workshop, we plan a series of online events and talks prior to the conference. Please stay tuned to find out more in due course.

### At the Conference

Participants of the workshop session will be motivated to provide feedback to their peers. Depending on the room and number of submissions, we will divide the presentations based on the field they focus on: vision applications, language applications, general concepts etc. Each of these working groups is asked to collect general patterns on what works and what doesn't. After this session, we will compile a report to summarize and publish the findings of this event and to lay the foundation for future activities.
